  "optimizedSchedule": "To optimize the given schedule, let's break down the tasks into categories and allocate study and work time efficiently based on deadlines, class times, and existing commitments.\n\n### 1. Overview of Key Dates and Commitments\n\n#### Exams and Quizzes\n- **BIO101 Exam**: 2024-02-15, 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM, Study Time: 10 hours\n- **SPAN201 Quiz**: 2024-03-05, 1:30 PM - 2:00 PM, Study Time: 5 hours\n\n#### Assignments\n- **BIO101 Research Paper**: Due 2024-03-10, 11:59 PM, Work Time: 15 hours\n- **SPAN201 Composition**: Due 2024-03-15, 5:00 PM, Work Time: 10 hours\n\n### 2. Class Schedules\n- **BIO101**: Mondays and Wednesdays, 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM\n- **SPAN201**: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 1:00 PM - 2:30 PM\n\n### 3. Optimization Strategy\n\n#### February 2024\n- **Preparation for BIO101 Exam**:\n  - Allocate 2 hours per day, starting from February 5th (post starting SPAN201) to February 14th (day before the exam), excluding weekends. This sums up to exactly 10 hours of study time.\n  \n#### March 2024\n- **Preparation for SPAN201 Quiz**:\n  - Allocate 1 hour per day from February 27th to March 4th. This sums up to 5 hours of study time right before the quiz.\n  \n- **BIO101 Research Paper**:\n  - Start early to avoid overlap with the SPAN201 quiz preparation.\n  - From February 16th (day after BIO101 exam) to February 28th, allocate 1.5 hours per day. This amounts to 15 hours across 10 days, skipping weekends.\n  \n- **SPAN201 Composition**:\n  - Start immediately after the SPAN201 quiz, from March 6th.\n  - Allocate 2 hours per day from March 6th to March 12th. This sums up to 10 hours across 5 days, assuming one day off for a break.\n\n### 4. Additional Tips\n- **Review"
